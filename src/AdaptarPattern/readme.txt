Provide an interface of two incompatible interface/object. Works as an bridge/mediator between two different object.
A great application is constantly hooked into other libraries and APIs, so we implement the adapter method, 
so that we do not experience any trouble when a third-party API or library changes its code base.

Example - Real-world examples might be a language translator, or a mobile charger. A Language translator can translate english, hindi language.
Example 2 - API method name change in API library

Difference between adapter and decorator pattern is - adaptar pattern make a wraper on two incompatible object. 
but decorator pattern change the functionality of an object in run time.
